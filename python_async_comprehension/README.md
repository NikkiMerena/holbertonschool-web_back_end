# Python Async Comprehension

In this project, you will learn about asynchronous programming in Python with a focus on async generators and comprehensions. By the end of the project, you should be able to create and work with async generators, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators without the help of external resources.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding how to write an asynchronous generator
- Understanding how to use async comprehensions
- Understanding how to type-annotate generators

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code should be compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- All files must end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Adhere to PEP8 (pycodestyle) style guide (version 2.5.x)
- All files will have length verified using `wc`
- All modules must contain proper documentation
  - You can check module documentation with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All functions must contain proper documentation
  - You can check function documentation with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- Proper type annotations must be present on all functions and coroutines
